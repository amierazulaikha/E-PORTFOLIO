## What I Have Gained üåê
Before I visited UTMDigital, I was introduced to it through attendance at a virtual talk. During the virtual talk, the speakers provided a variety of information about each level in the UTMDigital building. They also facilitated a Q&A session, allowing students to gain more insights into UTMDigital. So, during my visit to UTMDigital, I explored the building in depth. Each room serves a specific function, contributing various benefits to the university. Notably, the meeting room is equipped with advanced facilities, including a SMART TV symbolizing collaboration between UTMDigital and HUAWEI. This technology enables seamless meetings and collaborations, even with counterparts outside the country. The innovative setup enhances communication and collaboration, showcasing UTMDigital's commitment to providing state-of-the-art resources for its staff and contributing to a global academic network.

## Suggestions for Improvement üöÄ
From my perspective, UTMDigital could enhance Wi-Fi connectivity range and speed in various locations, contributing to a more seamless digital experience for staff and students. Additionally, there's an opportunity to enhance the user experience by adding more user-friendly features to the UTM Smart App. These upgrades align with the goal of providing a technologically advanced and user-centric environment at UTMDigital.

## Other Personal Reflections and Ideas üåü
During the visit, I observed a positive work environment cultivated by content and collaborative employees. The teamwork at UTMDigital is admirable, with team members consistently supporting one another. Their proactive approach to potential challenges is noteworthy; they have implemented a backup plan in case of server issues, maintaining a backup server in UTM KL for continuity during system downtime at UTM JB. This strategic planning reflects their commitment to maintaining uninterrupted service and underscores the importance of preparedness in the dynamic field of digital technology. üõ°Ô∏èüí°
